# Who are ColtProgers?


They are beginners to programming. Their habitat is [Google](google.com), [Habr](https://habr.com), [GitHub](https://github.com/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), etc. The most independent of them look for answers themselves, others ask stupid questions on various forums. Like a [colt](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/colt), they need someone more experienced nearby side. Like a colt, they can break something well-working that was done before. Be careful with them!
